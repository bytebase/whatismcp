Based on my experience implementing a [database MCP server](https://github.com/bytebase/dbhub/) written in TypeScript.

## Things I Like

### Choose JSON-RPC as the RPC Protocol

The two viable options for MCP were JSON-RPC and gRPC. I appreciate that MCP chose the former.
Although gRPC is more efficient, a JSON-based plain text protocol is more approachable. This
accessibility is important for MCP to achieve widespread adoption and aligns with the trend of
making development more accessible to a broader audience.

### Good Documentation

The [MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is clear, with [helpful examples](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/examples) that demonstrate practical implementations.

### Decent Debugging Tools

The [Inspector tool](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) has been invaluable. Beyond troubleshooting issues, I've used the Inspector to better understand MCP concepts.

I also use Claude Desktop for end-to-end testing. While the development cycle (build, restart Claude Desktop, test, fix code) could be streamlined, having a complete local debugging environment is more efficient than debugging against remote services.

## Things I Stumble

### Transport Complexity

> Update: With the [2025-03-26 protocol update](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/pull/206), Streamable HTTP is the default and SSE now becomes optional.

I believe the `sse` transport would be sufficient on its own. Adding the extra `stdio` transport introduces several complications:

First, lifecycle management differs between the two approaches. With `stdio`, the MCP client manages the MCP server lifecycle (e.g., during debugging, the Inspector launches the MCP server). For `sse`, the MCP server manages its own lifecycle (e.g., MCP server and Inspector start separately, and later the Inspector points to the MCP server endpoint).

I think most serious MCP servers need to manage their own lifecycle, especially when separate configuration is required.

Using `stdio` as a communication channel is also problematic. It forces developers to use `console.error` instead of `console.log` for debugging purposes. Additionally, there's the risk of dependent libraries inadvertently writing to `stdio` and interfering with communication.

Although I haven't implemented an MCP client yet, I suspect supporting both transport types complicates client implementation as well.

### Routing Limitations

I've identified a design issue with how the MCP host routes commands to the appropriate [MCP server, tool] pair.

My database MCP server implementation accepts a DSN to connect to a database:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dbhub": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@bytebase/dbhub",
        "--transport",
        "stdio",
        "--dsn",
        "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/dbname?sslmode=disable"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This approach presents two problems:

1. Users must load a new DBHub server for each database connection, which results in duplicate tool commands appearing in Claude Desktop.

1. While I could modify the implementation to allow DBHub to handle multiple databases, it remains unclear how to instruct the MCP host to route prompts to the specific desired database.

### Claude Desktop Limitations

1. Having to restart Claude Desktop to load a new MCP Server is annoying during development.

1. Claude Desktop [only supports the `stdio` transport](https://github.com/orgs/modelcontextprotocol/discussions/16),
   which forced me to reluctantly implement `stdio` support in my server.

1. I found [a bug](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/issues/812).

## Looking Ahead

Despite these challenges, I remain satisfied with the current state of MCP and optimistic about its future.
The [official roadmap](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/development/roadmap) outlines promising developments,
with Hierarchical Agent Systems (through namespacing and topology awareness) being particularly interesting to me.
This feature could address the routing limitations I encountered and provide MCP developers with improved debugging capabilities.

My biggest concern right now is the core MCP team seems to be quite understaffed. The ecosystem is picking up and new issues are accumulating fast. They need more hands.
